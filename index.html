          There have been reports of bots following a similar pattern joining channels. Although
          their true purpose is currently unknown, they can be a nuisance, and people have been
          suggesting they might be collecting channel and user statistics.
        </p>

        <h2 id="identifying" class="content-subhead">Identifying<a href="#identifying" class="content-link"></a></h2>
        <p>
          Nicknames of the bots usually consist of lowercase letters only, and their username and
          real name is fully or nearly identical to their nick. Their hostname is an IPv4 address.
          They don't respond to CTCP requests and private messages. Some of them idle in channels
          for a while, and others part straight away. A few are capable of rejoining on kick and
          <code>/remove</code>. They usually quit with the message <em>Remote host closed the connection</em>
          or <em>Ping timeout</em>.

          More recently, we have been seeing the following pattern:

          <pre>PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
1080/tcp open  socks5     Socks4A (Username/password authentication required)
8080/tcp open  http-proxy 3Proxy http proxy</pre>
        </p>

          The following is a frequently updated list of active bot IP ranges:

          <!--If you wish to ban these bots, you need to run these commands:

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/xnrand/551233f39cf1092a29b1.js"></script>

          Any users who match the bans will be forwarded to the channel <code>##not-a-honeypot</code>.
          It might be wise for you to join the channel in case an innocent user was caught by the bans.-->
          If you wish to ban these bots, you need to run this command in your channel(s):

          <pre>/mode +b $j:##botmonitoring-bots</pre>

          Any users who match the bans set in <code>##botmonitoring-bots</code> will be banned.
          Forwards are not supported for this type of ban.

        <p>
          We believe these bots find channels because they appear on <code>/list</code>, which lists
          every non-secret channel on freenode. You can remove your channel from the list by applying
          the channel mode +s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you could use +r to block unregistered users, or +S to block users not
          using a secure connection (SSL), however these could also cause problems for normal users.

        <ol>
          <li>Use common sense.</li>
          <li>Do not bring unauthorized bots to the channel. This includes client scripts with
              automated triggers replying in-channel.</li>
          <li>Do not message or CTCP users identified as possible bots in order to try and see if
              they're indeed a bot, unless you're fairly certain you're dealing with one.</li>
