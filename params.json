{"name":"freenode bot monitoring","tagline":"A project created to help fight the spy bot \"invasion\" on freenode.","body":"# Premise\r\n\r\nThere have been reports of bots following a similar pattern joining channels. Although their true purpose is currently unknown, they can be a nuisance, and people have been suggesting they might be collecting channel and user statistics.\r\n\r\n# Identifying\r\n\r\nNicknames of the bots usually consist of only lowercase letters, and their username and real name is fully or nearly identical to their nick. Their hostname is an IPv4 address. They don't respond to CTCP requests and private messages. Some of them idle in channels for a while, and others part straight away. A few are capable of rejoining on kick and `/remove`. They usually quit with the message *Remote host closed the connection* or *Ping timeout*.\r\n\r\nMore recently, we've been seeing the following pattern:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION\r\n1080/tcp open  socks5     Socks4A (Username/password authentication required)\r\n8080/tcp open  http-proxy 3Proxy http proxy\r\n```\r\n# Ranges\r\n\r\nThe following IP ranges are known to have been K-lined by freenode staff. However, we have no way of knowing if they still are, and this list may be incomplete.\r\n\r\n* 91.210.100.0/22\r\n* 91.212.45.0/24\r\n* 91.229.248.0/24\r\n* 193.28.144.0/24\r\n* 193.104.110.0/24\r\n* 193.105.154.0/24\r\n\r\nThe following IP ranges are currently being monitored:\r\n\r\n* 27.122.0.0/16\r\n* 46.165.0.0/16\r\n* 62.122.0.0/16\r\n* 66.172.0.0/16\r\n* 87.223.0.0/16\r\n* 91.200.0.0–91.255.255.255 (91.200.0.0/13, 91.208.0.0/12, 91.224.0.0/11)\r\n* 93.114.0.0/16\r\n* 109.201.0.0/16\r\n* 191.200.0.0–191.255.255.255 (191.200.0.0/13, 191.208.0.0/12, 191.224.0.0/11)\r\n* 193.28.0.0/16\r\n\r\n# Connect\r\n\r\nJoin `##botmonitoring` on the freenode IRC network.\r\n\r\n# Rules\r\n\r\n* Use common sense.\r\n* Do not send notices to the channel. Doing so will trigger a five-minute kickban.\r\n* Do not bring unauthorized bots to the channel. This includes client scripts with automated triggers replying in-channel.\r\n* Do not message or CTCP users identified as possible bots by hexagon, unless you're fairly certain you're dealing with a bot.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
